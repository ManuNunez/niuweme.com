        <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4">
            I am <strong>Manuel N√∫√±ez</strong>, a software developer and math enthusiast.  
            My passion for <strong>problem-solving</strong> has led me to focus both on teaching math olympiads and developing technological solutions.  
            I entered the world of teaching thanks to my personal experience as an ex-math olympian, and these experiences greatly motivated me to dive into competitive programming.  
            I firmly believe that a person who stops learning stops growing as an individual. I am dedicated to continuous learning and always strive to embrace new opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.
